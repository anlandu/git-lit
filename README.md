# git-lit
Literature, Open-Sourced.

In this project, I'll be taking a predominantly CS-focused medium--GitHub--and using it as a space in which I (and others) create literature, through both text and the broader structure of the repository. Contributions are welcome (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/anlandu/git-lit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!)
