## Contributing
You are welcome to contribute "literature" in whatever way you choose to interpret that term! I'm really fascinated to see potential crossovers between code and literature; alternatively, find a place in the repo that speaks to you (or create your own folder) and stick a piece in it! In the future I may focus on a more rigid structure but I'm leaving it fairly free-form for now. 

No need to create a new branch (unless that's part of your \~artistic process\~). Just fork, add your contribution, and send me a PR. If you're drawing a blank, see [Issues](https://github.com/anlandu/git-lit/issues) for miscellaneous prompts. Please do add your name to [Contributors.md](https://github.com/anlandu/git-lit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md). Cheers :)
