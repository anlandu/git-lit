## This is how it starts:
### Some post-midnight delirium, and it will be terrible, and I will re-read in the morning and cackle at the weighty overconfident conviction of my words. Delete them all. Ctrl-z, return to salvage some straggling phrase that insists on being saved.
Only this time my second guesses and atrocious sleep habits are written into the history of this repository--can I call this a history? The word implies that these thoughts deserve documentation and revisitation, but here documentation is rather automatic, so.

For those visitors who may be less familiar with GitHub, in order to place these thoughts in the public repository I must first "add" then "commit" then "push" them. The term "commit" feels apropos here: that is the step when the scribe named Git notes the changes I've made, the time (these days, rarely before midnight), and a descriptive (read: rambling) message documenting my intentions. That scribe stops in the middle of its scribblings sometimes, and I imagine it peering over spectacles to sneer at me: "is that really a change you would like to make?" or "can you remind me exactly why you chose to do that?" and I have to pause for a moment before committing and submitting myself to the public eye. So here's to vulnerability and openness, for better or for worse.
